# VTM-DAQ
VTM FSAE Data Aquistion System


Right now the Data Aquisition System uses at PIC32 microcontroller on a ChipKit-Mx7 Prototyping board, to interface a USB flash drive with 
analog inputs, CAN busses and other elements on the Virginia Tech Motorsports 2016 Internal Combustion Vehicle (VTM16c) for logging and
processing. 

Features in progress. 
  I2C communication with PSoC board for fast Sequencing SAR ADC Reads. 
  UART communication with XBee wireless transmitters for wireless telemetry as implemented on VTM15
  Strain gauge and torque telemetry, reading or logging
  Further Robustness and elegance for FSAE Michigan 2016 competition
